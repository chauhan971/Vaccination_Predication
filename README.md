# Vaccination_Predication
The above project is a data science project that aims to predict whether a person got the H1N1 vaccine or not using demographic and health-related information from a survey. The project uses simple linear regression algorithm to build a model that predicts the target variable, which is whether the person got the vaccine or not. The input variables for the model include age, sex, race, education level, household income, employment status, chronic health conditions, perceived risk of getting the H1N1 flu, and whether the person received seasonal flu vaccine in the past. The model's accuracy can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and the project's results can provide insights to public health officials to improve vaccination coverage in the population.
